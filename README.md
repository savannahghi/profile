## Installation Instructions

Use this package as a library by depending on it

Run this command:

- With Flutter:

$ flutter pub add user_profile
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit dart pub get):

```dart
dependencies:
  user_profile: ^0.1.12-nullsafety
```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

Lastly:

Import it like so:
